## Project Introduction

Crust provides a decentralized storage network of Web3.0 ecosystem. It supports multiple storage layer protocols such as IPFS, and exposes storage interfaces to application layer. Crustâ€™s technical stack is also capable of supporting a decentralized computing layer. It is designed to build a decentralized cloud ecosystem that values data privacy and ownership.

## Developer Activity

Crust Grants Program, launched by the Decentralized Cloud Foundation (DCF), rewards projects that add value to the Web 3.0 decentralized cloud storage ecosystem. Grants divides decentralized cloud storage into technology stacks at six layers, including chain protocol layer, file systems protocol layer, node strategies layer, development tools and infrastructure layer, blockchain-based applications layer and user-based applications layer, incentivizing projects in the decentralized cloud storage ecosystem at full strength. Details about Crust Grants can be checked on [Wiki](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/crustGrants).
